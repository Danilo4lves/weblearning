# Web Development Learning
Inside this GitHub repository you'll find some examples of what I've been learning and doing regarding web development.

## Explanation
I started out learning about web development a little while ago (a month or something like that) using a course on Udemy named [Web Design: Construa Sites com PHP, HTML, CSS e JavaScript](https://www.udemy.com/programacao-web-para-divulgacao-cientifica/) which now I have my progress on 45%.
Further, one friend of mine told me about a course that is way better and teachs about real modern web development, so that's where I'm at now. The course is [Curso Web Moderno com JavaScript 2019! COMPLETO + Projetos](https://www.udemy.com/curso-web/) and is way better and more complete.
