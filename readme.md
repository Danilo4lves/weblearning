# Web Development Learning
Inside this GitHub repository you'll find some examples of what I've been learning and doing regarding web development.

## 1. Explanation
I started out learning about web development a little while ago (a month or something like that) using a course on Udemy named [Web Design: Construa Sites com PHP, HTML, CSS e JavaScript](https://www.udemy.com/programacao-web-para-divulgacao-cientifica/) which now I have my progress on 45%.
Further, one friend of mine told me about a course that is way better and teachs about real modern web development, so that's where I'm at now. The course is [Curso Web Moderno com JavaScript 2019! COMPLETO + Projetos](https://www.udemy.com/curso-web/).

## 1.1 web paste
Inside the web paste there are some html and css projects that I did alongside the first course.

## 1.2 exercicios-js paste
This paste holds the exercises and notes I've been doing following the second course.
### 1.2.1 Structure of the paste
As much of Udemy's courses, they are organized in sections and inside these sections there are the lessons. For example: 
```
Section 1 {
	Lesson 1
	Lesson 2
	Lesson 3
	Lesson 4
	...
}
...
```
So, it's easy to notice that I'm putting the name of the files according to the sections and lessons. Let's take as an example the fundamentals folder, it's name is
```
section3_fundamentals
```
Inside this folder, the note/exercise about a certain lesson is explicitly told in the name of the file, for example, the lesson 50 is as showed below:
```
50errorTreatment.js
```
